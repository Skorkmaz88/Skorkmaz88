- 👋 Hi, I’m Semih Korkmaz, and I just learned I can use these wonderful 😲 icons 🙂 in Github.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of stuff, so Github template won't be a good fit, but seriously I enjoy discovering about a spectrum of computer science problems. Especially any machinery that can act in interesting yet suprising ways 🎁
- 🌱 I’m currently learning well it has been awhile i couldn't really put my mind to study but hope to be back to cover my gaps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to discover and sometimes just discuss and brainstorm different ideas and projects.
